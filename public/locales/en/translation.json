During my studies I was involved in scientific research using eyetracking. I am working hard to develop myself, which in 2021 resulted in the first place in the ZFSNT NOT RRZ competition in Szczecin under the title \"Distinguished Young Technician / Engineer\" in the \"scientific activity\" category. I was also a participant in the project entitled \"School of Eagles\", which gives opportunities for an individual path of education based on the tutoring method for the best students of my university. In the last year of my studies, I was awarded a scholarship of the Minister of Education and Science for significant achievements",
